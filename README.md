# JAva-MAtrix-Matlab-Extension
Extension of the original JAMA (JAva MAtrix) package from NIST &amp; MathWorks to include Matlab functions that were missing from JAMA.

This project is based on the original JAMA (https://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/) which was first written in 1998 by MathWorks (developer of Matlab) and NIST. The original had 5 classes, this extension has 500+ files. The package is Matlab-like, meaning that Matlab codes can be easily ported into Java but with less headaches. There are other packages that are available in this JAMA-extension that were ported from their oritinal Matlab packages.
