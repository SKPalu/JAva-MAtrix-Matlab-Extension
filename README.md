# JAva-MAtrix-Matlab-Extension
Extension of the original JAMA (JAva MAtrix) package from NIST &amp; MathWorks to include Matlab functions that were missing from JAMA. I've used this JAMA extension over the years for various projects and it's still growing.

This project is based on the original JAMA (https://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/) which was first written in 1998 by MathWorks (developer of Matlab) and NIST. The original had 5 classes, but the JAMA Matlab-like extension here has 500+ files. The package is Matlab-like, meaning that Matlab codes can be easily ported into Java but with less headaches. There are other packages that are available in this JAMA-extension that were ported from their oritinal Matlab packages.

The original JAMA does not have any "Complex Number" classes, but a similar package "jampackx" is also bundled here so computing with Complex Numbers is available.

There's another similar project here on Github, the LAML, which is a pure Java library for linear algebra and machine learning (https://github.com/SionePalu/LAML)that is also folked from the authors' page here. The JAMA extension will be slowly migrated into LAML & Apache Spark Machine Learning (https://spark.apache.org/mllib/) over time. This means that the JAMA extension will be rewritten in LAML and Spark, so one can deal with distributed compuation for large datasets. Let's be clear here. The Spark Machine Learning API still lacks machine-learning sophistications. It's not lacking small time. It's lacking big time. One can only find the standard machine learning algorithms in Spark. Anything more sopshisticated, it's missing. For example, topics in Multi-task, Multi-view, Subspace, Domain-Adaptation learning and so forth, will be available.
